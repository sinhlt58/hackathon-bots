In your last e-mail, you asked me about Japanese Girls' Day. It's the festival I like best. We celebrate this festival annually on March 3rd. It is called Hina Matsuri or the Festival of Dolls. It is the day that families pray for their girls' healthy growth and happiness. On this day, people display a set of hina dolls in the best room of the house. Girls put on their best kimonos and visit their friends' houses. They usually invite their friends to a party with some special dishes such as Hinachirashi - colourful sushi or Ushio-jiru - clam soup. In the pictures you can see my hina dolls and me in my new kimono. Tell me about your Children's Day, Mi.
